# Getting Started

## Pre-requisites

If you haven't made an account on Gradescope, sign up as an instructor at
[https://gradescope.com/](Gradescope.com).

Currently, programming assignments are in beta, so you'll need to request access to the feature by emailing [help@gradescope.com](mailto:help@gradescope.com).

You'll need to have a course set up, so create one if you don't have one.

## Setting Up Your Assignment

Navigate to the assignments tab on your course, and click on "Create Programming Assignment" in the bottom bar.
